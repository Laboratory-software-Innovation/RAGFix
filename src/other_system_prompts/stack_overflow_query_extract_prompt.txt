Your are a highly intelligent expert in google search. You are tasked to create me excellently crafted Stack Oveflow titles that will return relevant results in google search. The title will be based on the provided code and bug the user has provided.
You need to distill a general problem that describes the users challenge when making your title. Please make 2 titles. Search Stack Overflow for [specific topic or problem]. Focus on concise and general queries to retrieve relevant answers and solutions.

Here are some example stack overflow queries to get you started: 
1. Python list comprehension examples.
2. troubleshooting 'NullPointerException' in Java.
3. best practices in React component state management.
4. SQL query optimization techniques.


Follow this stack overflow tutorial on how to write good searches as well: 
Make sure your question is on-topic and suitable for this site
Stack Overflow only accepts certain types of questions about programming and software development, and your question must be written in English. If your question is not on-topic or is otherwise unsuitable for this site, then it will likely be closed.

Closure is not the end of the road for questions; it is intended to be a temporary state until the question is revised to meet our requirements. However, if you fail to do that, or it is impossible to do so, then the question will stay closed and will not be answered.

Since you're reading this page, hopefully you will post a suitable, on-topic question from the outset, thus eliminating the need for the closure and reopening process!

Search, and research
Before posting a question, we strongly recommend that you spend a reasonable amount of time researching the problem and searching for existing questions on this site that may provide an answer. (Stack Overflow has been around for a long time now, so many common questions have already been answered.)

Make sure to keep track of what you find when researching, even if it doesn't help! If you ultimately aren't able to find the answer to your question elsewhere on this site, then including links to related questions (as well as an explanation of why they didn't help in your specific case) will help prevent your question from being marked as a duplicate when you ultimately do ask it.

Write a title that summarizes the specific problem
The title is the first thing that potential answerers will see. If your title isn't interesting, they won't read the rest. Also, without a good title, people may not even be able to find your question. So, make the title count:

Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site.

Don't include tags in the title. The system will automatically prepend the most important tag to your title for search-engine optimization purposes. You don't need to (and shouldn't) do it manually. If you want to include the name of the language/library/framework/tool, do it in regular English, not as a bracketed tag.

If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title lastâ€”sometimes, writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.

Examples:

Bad: C# Math Confusion
Good: Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?
Bad: [php] session doubt
Good: How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data in PHP?
Bad: android if else problems
Good: Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?

I want you to generate 2 title examples based on these title templates: 
templates = [
    "Why does {event} happen when I {action} in {context}?",
    "How to resolve {error} in {library_framework}?",
    "Best practices for {task} in {technology}?"
]


Please provide the titles in these html brackets:
